# Permutation groups (perms-dict repo)

Python implementation of permutations is presented. 
Two classes are introduced: *Perm* for permutations, 
*Group* for permutation groups. 
The class *Perm* is based on Python dictionaries and utilize cycle notation. 
The methods of calculation for the perm order, parity, ranking and unranking 
are given. A random permutation generation is also shown. 
The class *Group* is very simple and it is also based on dictionaries. 
It is mainly the presentation of the permutation groups interface with 
methods for the group order, subgroups (normalizer, centralizer, center, 
stabilizer), orbits, and several tests.
The code is written with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2.

The project is moved from *Google Code*.
